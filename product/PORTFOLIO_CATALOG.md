## Migration Status

> Products are being migrated from flat ATLAS.md structure to the 4-layer Atomic Architecture.
> During migration, `ATLAS.md` in each product folder remains the detailed source of truth.
> `PRODUCT.md` and `CAPABILITY.md` files are extractions. `FEATURE_<name>.md` files are pending engineering owner assignment.
